          <h1 style="margin:0px;">I was part of the show’s pilot group that helped perfect the scripting and content to be pitched to NBC. Throughout my recurring appearances in pilot episodes, I was able to memorize a random deck of 52 cards in order, navigate around the NYC subway system by memory, solve brain-jumbling visual spatial problems, and more. In 2018, NBC released the first season hosted by Neil Patrick Harris.

          <h1 style="margin:0px;">Procter & Gamble representatives worked with a select group of students from my middle school to brainstorm a new product idea. After many discussions, we decided that dehydrated plants with medicinal properties would be tightly packed into designated areas of rockets and sent to space as a way of providing astronauts with necessary nutrients that are naturally grown.</h1>

        <div class="back">
          <h1 style="margin:0px;">I initiated a collaboration between the Ad Astra School and the nearby Tempest gym. At the time, the school did not have an athletics program. To solve this, I contacted the manager of the South Bay Tempest location and organized a partnership. This included scheduling morning and afternoon SpaceX shuttles to transport students and advertising it to the students. Approximately 60% of the school joined the program in the first year.</h1>

          <h1 style="margin:0px;">OROS uses aerogel insulation to create a line of clothing. My partner and I created 3D designs for a variety of products, as well as testing the material to see what configurations would be most effective. By the end of the designing period, one of our blueprints was chosen to move onto the next round in the manufacturing process.</h1>

One of my own CONUNDRUMS was animated and released in the first season (“The Treasure Conundrum”).</h1>

Unfortunately, due to COVID restrictions, in-person competitions were discontinued and competitions were held online through simulations of the robots. </h1>
